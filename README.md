🚦 Intelligent Traffic Management System using YOLOv7

📋 Overview
An AI-powered traffic management system that revolutionizes traditional traffic signals by integrating state-of-the-art computer vision and machine learning technologies. The system uses YOLOv7 for real-time vehicle detection and dynamically adjusts traffic signal timings based on traffic density, with special prioritization for emergency vehicles.

 Achievements
Under review for publication in academic journals
Reduction in manual traffic management processing
Real-time performance with high accuracy vehicle detection

Key Features
